# 🌞 Sunspot Time Series Analysis (1749–2025)

This project explores long-term solar activity using monthly sunspot data from the SILSO network. It applies time series analysis and forecasting techniques to investigate cyclical solar patterns and assess how data quality affects model performance.

---

## 📌 Research Question

**How accurately can long-term sunspot activity be forecasted using historical data from 1749 to 2025, and what impact do data quality and observational inconsistencies have on model performance?**
